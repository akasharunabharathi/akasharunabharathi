### Hi there ðŸ‘‹! 

I'm Akash, a junior in CS and Philosophy at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I love Computer Vision, ML, and messing around with Raspberry Pis and Arduinos :)

Here are results from some cool stuff I've worked on! Includes stuff I worked on out of curiosity and out of humor. Read on to know more!

First, the projects.

### What am I currently working on?

A couple things. I'm working on two independent LLM projects (more details coming soon), completing my MLOps Specialization, and am also working on the Harmful Brain Activity Classification Challenge on Kaggle. Will push some results from my first experiments soon!

### Most-recently, I worked on training a classifier to distinguish between different subtypes of Ovarian Cancer.

Since the dataset was exteremly imabalanced, I implemented Class weighting and Weighted loss to mitigate the issue. I'm now exploring implementing SMOTE (Sample Minority Oversampling Technique). See ![here](https://github.com/akasharunabharathi/ovarian-cancer-subtype-classification/blob/main/ubc-ovarian-cancer-subtype-classification.ipynb) for more info.

### I was curious about Generative Models and their iniability to generate images of hands. So, I built a GAN.

Vox media published a video claiming that it was hard for generative AI models to generate images of hands. However, all examples of images presented in the video were generated by diffusion models. I wanted to see if the statement held true for GANs as well, and implemented the DC-GAN model to test for the same.

The statement did hold up, these are some of the images I generated. ðŸ˜•

See ![this notebook](https://github.com/akasharunabharathi/hand-gan/blob/main/HandGan.ipynb) for more info, and see ![here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24yjRbBah3w&ab_channel=Vox) for the original Vox video.

## And here comes the fun stuff!! Some meme-worthy results from stuff I worked on in the last 3-4 months:


### Doge-lisa: Poisson Blending for Fun

Played around with Poisson blending ðŸ‘† :)


### Harry, Hermione and the Polyjuice Potion: Image Processing in the Frequency Domain

See Harry in the regular sized image and Hermione in the zoomed out version!

Here, I added high frequency and low frequency features of two distinct images in the frequency domain.
